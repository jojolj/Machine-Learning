    "When applying machine learning to prediction problems, our main objective is to find a model that can accurately predict the label of data points for which it is yet unknown.

    "## What is model validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation is the process of evaluating the predictive capability of a ML model on new data points. By using good model validation techniques, we can estimate the performance of a ML model with a reasonable confidence prior to its use in practice. Before we dive into the details of model validation, we will briefly consider **overfitting** in order to show why model validation is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to predict a label $y$ of data points based on their features $\\mathbf{x}$. In order to do this, we choose a ML model and train it on a set of labelled data by minimizing the average loss of its predictions. A naive approach we might then take to estimate the performance of the trained model is to calculate its training error, which we assume to be equivalent to the average loss. Unfortunately, this approach is highly problematic and leads to overly optimistic estimates of the model's predictive capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training error is a poor estimate of a model's predictive performance because it is calculated on the same dataset that was used to train the model. Since this dataset only represents a small sample of all available data points, it is likely that a predictor that minimizes the average loss on the training set happens to fit this dataset particularly well. Consequently, the average loss on the training set will, in general, overestimate the performance of the model. This phenomenon is referred to as **overfitting**, because the trained model fits the training set overly well.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some degree of overfitting is typically present when applying a ML model to a prediction problem, it is a particularly significant issue when applying ML models with large hypothesis spaces that contain complex predictor functions (in relation to the size of the dataset). In such cases, a model that seemingly fits the data very well might turn out to perform very poorly on data points not in the training set. This type of situation is exemplified in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../coursedata/3_ModelValSel/overfitting.png\" width=500/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure visualizes a dataset containing $m=20$ data points, along with two different predictor functions that were obtained by training two ML models on the four data points indicated by the orange crosses. The green predictor belongs to a standard linear regression model, while the red predictor belongs to a more complex, 4th degree polynomial model. The key observation regarding the predictors is that while the more complex model fits the data used for training very well, it has a much poorer fit on the rest of the data than the simpler linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the figure above seems like an extreme example due to miniscule number of data points in the training set, it nonetheless makes an important point. If we do not have the capacity to validate a model's performance on data points outside the training set, we will likely  overestimate the predictive capability of complex models due to overfitting. This sets us up for a great let-down when applying the models in practice. Furthermore, we will end up selecting overly complex models over simpler ones when choosing between many candidate models. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, it is worth emphasizing that the optimal complexity of the predictor function is generally dependent on the dataset's size. A deep neural network might generalize well when trained on a huge dataset, whereas even a linear model using many features might be prone to severe overfitting on a small dataset."

Typically, the dataset used for training is referred to as the **training set**, and the data used for validation is referred to as the **validation set**. The image below visualizes a dataset split into a training and validation set.\n",

Assume that we have a dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ at our disposal, and that we wish to train a ML model that can predict the label $y$ of data points based on their features $\\mathbf{x}$. To be able to later validate the performance of the model, we will first split the dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ into a training set denoted by $\\mathbb{X}^{(t)}$ and a validation set denoted by $\\mathbb{X}^{(v)}$. The recommended size of the validation set is somewhat context dependent, but a common choice is 20-30% of the entire dataset.\n",

    "After splitting the dataset, we train our model on the training set by minimizing the average loss.

These features include the average number of rooms in the apartments, the percentage of buildings constructed before 1970 in the neighborhood, as well as eight experimental features designed by your colleagues in research. In addition, the fund's domain experts have valued a representative sample of apartments in each of the 20 neighborhoods and have arrived at a reliable estimate for the median apartment price in each one. This valuation has cost the fund a fortune, but the investment will pay off if your ML model can use this information to accurately predict the median apartment value of other neighborhoods at a negligible cost.*\n",

The data points in this problem are the different neighborhoods, and the label of these is the median apartment price.

However, this does not necessarily lead to better performance on new data. A complex model with too many features (large $r$) might only fit the training data very well, and generalize poorly to new data.\n",

    "Consider the case of $r=m_{\\rm train}$, i.e., the number of features is the same as the number of labeled data points in the training set. Under very mild conditions it can be shown that in this case there always exists a linear predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$ such that $y^{(i)} = h(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$, i.e., the training error is exactly zero! \n",

    "In the figure, we can see that the validation error behaves very differently in comparison to the training error. The validation error obtains its minimum value at $r=2$ whereas the training error is monotonously decreasing with respect to $r$. It is clear that the training error is misleading as a measure of a model's performance on new data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the validation error in the figure above exposes the uselessness of the training error, the simple validation scheme we used is not perfect either. If the dataset used for training and validation is not very large, the amount of data points in the validation set might be insufficient for reliably describing the distribution of data points in general. Consequently, the average error on the validation set might not accurately reflect the performance of the model on new data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the validation error for $r=2$ is much lower than the training error in the figure above. Since ML models have a tendency to overfit the training set, the error on the validation set should not be lower than the training error if both sets accurately represent the distribution of the data. Therefore, we have a strong reason to believe that the validation set used in the task above just happens to fit the trained predictor for $r=2$ very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the reliability of the validation error can be easily improved by averaging multiple validation errors calculated using different training and validation sets. This approach is called $K$-fold cross-validation, and is presented next in more detail. "

    "## K-fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "When the amount of data available for training and validation is limited, there is a trade-off between overfitting the training set and the reliability of the validation error. On one hand, a smaller training set makes the models more prone to overfitting, but on the other, a smaller validation set leads to a less reliable estimate of the model's generalization capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can largely be avoided by using a more sophisticated validation method called **$K$-fold cross-validation**. In $K$-fold cross-validation, the data is first split into $K$ approximately equally sized subsets. Then, the subsets are used to calculate $K$ different estimates of the validation error, so that the $i$:th estimate is calculated using the $i$:th subset as the validation set and the remaining $K-1$ subsets as the training set. Finally, the $K$ estimates are averaged to obtain a final estimate of the validation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, a diagram of  5-fold cross-validation is depicted below. For each split, the subset used as the validation set is indicated with blue color box and the training set with green color. For each split we fit a model to training set (green) and compute validation error on validation set (blue). Five validation errors then averaged to get 5-fold cross-validation error.\n",

    "If we compare the figure above to the one in the previous student task, we can see that the validation error obtained by 5-fold cross-validation seems to provide a more realistic estimate of the model's performance on new data. The validation error is now consistently larger than the training error, and the validation error seems less erratic. In practice, it is almost always preferable to use K-fold cross-validation instead of a single validation split for model validation and selection due to the increased robustness of the validation error.\n",

As such, it would seem that the experimental features in the dataset were not beneficial after all.\n",

    "## Estimating the accuracy of the selected model on a separate test set\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use validation error to select the model with the best performance on new data out of many candidate models. In most applications, we are also interested in obtaining an estimate of the performance of the selected model on new data. To this end, it would seem convenient to use the validation error from the model selection phase, but unfortunately this generally results in an overly optimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation error is, in general, an excessively optimistic estimate of the performance of the final model **since the model is chosen based on this value**. We can persuade ourselves of the validity of this statement by imagining two different models with a negligible difference in the expected error on new data points. **If we select one of these models based on the models' validation errors on a finite validation set, we will end up selecting the model that happens to fit the validation set better**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is to use a separate dataset, frequently referred to as the **test set**, for testing the performance of the final model. In practice, the test set is most often obtained by selecting a part of the original dataset for this purpose. The rest of the data points are then used to train and validate the different model candidates using the methods described in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, it is good to emphasize that the separate test set is only necessary when we have selected a model based on the validation error. If we are only interested in obtaining the performance estimate for one model, a single validation/test set suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- In model selection (or hyperparameter tuning), we would ideally like to choose the model with the smallest ***expected*** error. However, since this is not possible (we don't know the true data distribution) we use validation error as a tractable alternative - it is our hope that the validation error reflects the true expected error more faithfully (compared to training error). Test error is similarly motivated, with the central difference that we are not using it to select a model, but rather to give us an estimate for the true performance of an already trained (fixed) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any data that has had an influence on the model (through training, tuning or selection) can no longer be used to provide you with a reliable estimate of the model's (true) performance (on the unseen data)."

Large hypothesis spaces typically contain complex predictors that achieve very low training errors by overfitting the data. Thus, if we search for the optimal predictor in this hypothesis space (i.e., train the model) by minimizing the training error, we will obtain a predictor that overfits the training data and generalizes poorly to other data. However, there might be predictors in the hypothesis space that generalize much better to new data even though they have a higher average loss than the learned predictor. In order to learn these predictors, the model must be trained by minimizing some other quantity than the average loss.\n",

Furthermore, you must define the parameters `scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'`, `cv=5`, and `return_train_score=True`. Here, `scoring` defines the metric with which training and validation errors are calculated, `cv` the number of splits in the $K$-fold cross-validation, and `return_train_score` whether or not training errors are calculated.\n",

    "5. Save the training and validation errors in numpy arrays `err_train` and `err_val`, respectively. The grid-search results are found in the attribute `cv_results_` of the `GridSearchCV` object. The results are stored in a dict, and the training and validation scores are accessed with the keys `mean_train_score` and `mean_test_score`. `GridSearchCV` uses negative MSE instead of MSE for implementational reasons, so you must remember to turn the errors positive when defining `err_train` and `err_val`.\n",
